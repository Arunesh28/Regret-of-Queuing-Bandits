#### Paper Intro :
In this paper we see a variant of the stochastic MAB motivated by queuing applications. Arms are pulled upon arrival of jobs (jobs are waiting in a queue). Each arm is a server which services the arriving jobs. If a arm on pulled gives a positive reward then the job is successfully serviced. Else the service was unsuccessful and the job stays in the queue. Our aim is to choose the arm with highest success probability i.e the arm which most likely services the job successfully.
